I dreamt of a golden tower
Built by mine own hands
That lanced the clouds and
Stabbed through heaven
And drenched the cosmos with life.
I dreamt.
And so none bore witness
To the shine and the hum
And the meat of it all.

—Then I wake, 
And I walk, 
And I work, 
And I live; 
And it lives on its own 
And East dies again. 
I look toward that temporary immortal 
And I see virgin land 
Seeded with flint that speaks 
And words that burn.

​I turn my back 
to the gold-flecked throat of the morning 
And seek comfort in the dust at my feet. 
I walk and I walk and I walk 
But this stillness is a glutton; 
A quiet erosion more violent than the gale. 
So I give my weight to the edge of the world,
To the shine and the hum and the meat, 
Because going is a lesser death
Than staying.
