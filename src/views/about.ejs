I dreamt of a golden tower
Built by mine own hands
That lanced the clouds and
Stabbed through heaven
And drenched the cosmos with life.
I dreamt.
And so none bore witness
To the shine and the hum
And the meat of it all.

—Then I wake, 
And I walk, 
And I work, 
And I live; 
And it lives on its own 
And East dies again. 
I look toward that temporary immortal 
And I see virgin land 
seeded with flint that speaks 
And words that burn.
